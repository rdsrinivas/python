Classes like Animal and Fruit make it easy to understand the concepts of classes and instances, but you probably won't see many zebras or lemons in real-world programs.

However, classes and objects are often used to model real-world objects. The code in the editor is a more realistic demonstration of the kind of classes and objects you might find in commercial software. Here we have a basic ShoppingCart class for creating shopping cart objects for website customers; though basic, it's similar to what you'd see in a real program.
Instructions

Create an instance of ShoppingCart called my_cart. Initialize it with any values you like, then use the add_item method to add an item to your cart.

class ShoppingCart(object):
    """Creates shopping cart objects
    for users of our fine website."""
    items_in_cart = {}
    def __init__(self, customer_name):
        self.customer_name = customer_name

    def add_item(self, product, price):

        if not product in self.items_in_cart:
            self.items_in_cart[product] = price
            print product + " added."
        else:
            print product + " is already in the cart."

        if product in self.items_in_cart:
            del self.items_in_cart[product]
            print product + " removed."
        else:
            print product + " is not in the cart."

my_cart.add_item("pencil", 5)
