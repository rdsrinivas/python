List Slicing

Great! Next up: list slicing.

str = "ABCDEFGHIJ"
start, end, stride = 1, 6, 2
str[start:end:stride]

You can think of a Python string as a list of characters.
Instructions

The string in the editor is garbled in two ways:

    First, our message is backwards;
    Second, the letter we want is every other letter.

Use list slicing to extract the message and save it to a variable called message.

garbled = "!XeXgXaXsXsXeXmX XtXeXrXcXeXsX XeXhXtX XmXaX XI"
message = garbled[::-2]
